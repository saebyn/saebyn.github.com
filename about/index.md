For those of you that haven’t noticed yet: My name is John Weaver, and (among other things) I’m a software developer and entrepreneur who lives near Olympia, Washington. This is where I am going to relate some anecdotes about myself that will hopefully give you a better idea of who it is that is writing all of this text hanging out here in cyberspace.

I like solving problems, building systems, and learning new things. I love building powerful user interfaces, deep data visualizations, and scalable backend services. I live `devops`. I like being part of a small, focused team of innovators and building solutions that make the world a little more organized and thoughtful.

When I'm not making software, I'm exploring the works of others: fanfic, YouTube let's plays, twitch streams, and new projects on GitHub.
