As promised, here are some details about my new OCR project. It is an implementation of <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/shape/belongie-nips00.ps.gz">Shape Context</a> matching, using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munkres'_assignment_algorithm">Munkres assignment algorithm </a>to solve the weighted bipartite matching problem. I will be using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_plate_spline">Thin Plate Splines</a> to evaluate potential matches. I am also implementing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny">Canny edge detection algorithm</a> for this project.

I hope to be able to release some code examples in the next couple of weeks, so stay tuned.
