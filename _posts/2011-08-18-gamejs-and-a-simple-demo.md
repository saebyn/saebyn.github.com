I'm using this library called [gamejs](https://github.com/oberhamsi/gamejs) to
abstract over the HTML5 canvas API. It's an incomplete reimplementation of
[pygame](http://pygame.org/), which is a very popular 2d graphics (among other
things) package for Python, in Javascript.

Here's where I'm hosting a simple demo of my game code in action: [http
