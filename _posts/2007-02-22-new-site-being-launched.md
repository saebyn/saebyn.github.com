I'm opening <del><a href="http://quickscriptsnow.com/">QuickScriptsNow.com</a></del> today. It will be offering various PHP, Python, and Javascript scripts. Our featured (and currently only) product is our Ad Rotator script, which uses XmlHttpRequest to pull an XML configuration file off the web host and then uses the configuration details in that to choose which ads to display. I'm pretty excited about this site, and I hope that the products that I can bring to market through it will get other people excited as well.
