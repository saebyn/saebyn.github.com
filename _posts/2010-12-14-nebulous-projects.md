I was recently asked how I deal with nebulous or otherwise confused projects.
Here's what I told them:

Ill-defined projects have been par for the course during my freelance software
development career. If the client had no experience as a programmer, and had
not already hired someone to refine their project requirements, they
frequently came to me with a proposal too vague to transform into a finished
product. The key to refining and focusing a project's goals is to focus on the
client's original thought process, and possibly the sequence of events which
caused them to seek my expertise.

I start by determining how to shape the project so that it is computationally
and financially practical, and addresses the client's most important business
needs. Then, I break down the problems into smaller parts, and prioritize
individual items with respect to both business need and risk (how hard will
this actually be to implement, will that even be possible, etc). This strategy
eventually results in requirements that are clear enough for me to feel
comfortable coding a solution.
