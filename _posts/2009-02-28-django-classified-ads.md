Announcing the release of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-classified-ads/">django-classified-ads</a>, which is being hosted by Google Code. For everyone who has e-mailed me about this project... here it is! All of the templates and static media (CSS, images, jQuery, and TinyMCE) from django-classifieds.zxdevelopment.com has been included in the source code repository. I've replaced some of the older custom code with existing Django applications like <a rel="nofollow" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-profiles/">django-profiles</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/wiki/Home">django-registration</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://github.com/johnboxall/django-paypal/tree/master">django-paypal</a>.

Update: <a href="https://github.com/saebyn/django-classifieds">This code is now available on github</a>
