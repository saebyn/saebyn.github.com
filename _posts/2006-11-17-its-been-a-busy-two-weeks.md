Thanks to a new (currently unnamed) partnership, several new projects have come my way. Most of the work on the first project revolved around modifing an existing PHP solution to add new functionality,  and applying several templates to various parts of the site. I'm still waiting for details on the other projects, and so I had a little time to update this blog.
