Well, it's been a busy few weeks, lots of small projects that needed to be caught up on. Recently, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.openid.net/">OpenID</a>, an open, decentralized, free framework for user-centric digital identity.  I decided to use OpenID for my new social/community site (ala MySpace), and provide OpenID URLs to members. It isn't online yet, as it's still in development, but I'm quite excited about it already.

I also decided it was time to start using the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo.php">PHP Data Objects (PDO)</a> classes for my database interface needs. It's a more portable, cleaner looking, and a more easily mantained way to manage database access than the specific database interfaces that come with PHP. Other than a small issue of having persistent connections enabled causing errors, which I fixed by disabling persistent connections for the time being, everything is going smoothly.
