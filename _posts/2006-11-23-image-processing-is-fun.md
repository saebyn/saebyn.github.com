Well, busy as always. I've been trying my hand at some image processing and OCR work. There is a <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/shape/sc_digits.html">lot of material out there</a>, some good papers, and lots of very <a href="http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~weg22/edge.html">helpful tutorials</a> on edge detection algorithms. This isn't really an area that I've focused in before, but I am always looking to expand my expertise.
