My blog has a new theme! I spent a few hours today working on a design from my friend Dima at <a href="http://www.tyzdesign.net/">TYZ Design</a>, and I'm pretty happy with the results. I plan on making some small changes to the appearance of links, and fix some XHTML validation errors in the next few days.
