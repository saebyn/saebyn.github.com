While I have used <a href="http://www.jquery.com/">jQuery</a> (a javascript utility library) in the past, I generally have fallen back to the <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype JS</a> library. This was mostly because I was already familiar with it from my work on FamilySnap, and because it can be difficult to find the time to fit in learning another tool when it's not completely necessary to do so.</p>
