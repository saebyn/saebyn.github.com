excerpt: I've been busy working on several PHP/MySQL web development projects. For the last few of them, I have been using PHP Object Generator to generate all of my Database Abstraction Layer/ORM code. One of the new things I have been trying out is modeling my database using UML. I used to sit down with phpMyAdmin and do my database design directly in SQL, but since I am going through POG to create the database, that wasn't an option anymore.</p>

I've been busy working on several PHP/MySQL web development projects. For the last few of them, I have been using <a href="http://www.phpobjectgenerator.com/">PHP Object Generator</a> to generate all of my Database Abstraction Layer/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a> code. One of the new things I have been trying out is modeling my database using UML. I used to sit down with phpMyAdmin and do my database design directly in SQL, but since I am going through POG to create the database, that wasn't an option anymore.

<!--more-->So I started using <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Dia">Dia</a>, and started modeling my tables as objects. That still left me with entering the field names from the diagram into the form for my local copy of POG. So I recently decided that I should write a script that transformed the dia XML format into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> request to POG (POG has a built-in SOAP interface to its object generator), and then create the files for each class with the returned code.

<a href="http://johnweaver.zxdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/dia2pog.zip">I'm releasing the code</a> to my little python script. There isn't much error checking (or comments), and it may break on certain diagrams. Read the source for more details.
