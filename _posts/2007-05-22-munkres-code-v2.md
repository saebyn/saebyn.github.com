As promised, <del><a title="Munkres code v2." href="#">here is the updated version</a></del> of my Munkres
algorithm code. The memory leak issue has been fixed, as well as the problems with the code sometimes failing to find a linear assignment for larger matrices.

Update: <a href="https://github.com/saebyn/munkres-cpp">This code is now available on github</a>
