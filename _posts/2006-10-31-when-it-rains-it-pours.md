In the past two weeks my workload has gone from a little less than I would like, to almost more than I can handle. My current projects include a C++ 2D overhead game, a myspace clone customization, and debugging a C#-based Google AdWords API ad submitter application.

Things are coming along though, and I hope to have a little more time to attend to this blog and <a href="http://www.zxdevelopment.com/">my company's main site</a>.
