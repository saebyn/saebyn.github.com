I want to point out a <a href="http://birdhouse.org/blog/2008/11/19/notes-on-a-django-migration/">great article by Scot Hacker</a>, about his experiences migrating to a <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> based platform. My company is in the process of a similar migration itself for similar reasons, if not quite the same background. <a href="http://www.zxdevelopment.com/">Our new website</a> is now written completely in Python using the Django web framework, and we are now in the process of adding some new features and content. We are also working on some new projects written using Django, which will be launched in the next month or two.
