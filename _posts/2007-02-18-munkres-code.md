Well, I said I would try to get some code from my OCR project out, and <s>here it is</s>. This is my implementation of the Munkres linear assignment problem over a rectangular matrix. I also included a bare-bones matrix utility class. I am releasing this code under the GPL.

16 April 2007 Update: There seems to be an issue with my implementation when dealing with NxN matrices with N greater than 100. Also, the example code in munkes.h is not correct. I will be posting fixes shortly in a separate post.

22 May 2007 Update: Sorry it took so long... please see my <a href="/2007/05/22/munkres-code-v2/">new post</a>.
